TmnlUtils is a suit of short command line programs written in go. I primarily use the different commands to more easily access the command line tools that I use on a daily basis. Below is a list of dependencies that you need to have to use TmnlUtils! All software below is available for (most) Linux-based distros and MacOS (the build-in terminal as well as iTerm2). The go code in this repository is simply a wrapper around those programs! Again, you NEED to have working versions of all of them to use TmnlUtils. However, feel free to take my code and use it with whatever terminal commands you hate to tip in over and over again. 

You will find cheat sheets for mupdf, feh, cmux, qutebrowser, ranger, and vim in */cheatsheets*. If you pull the contents of this repo with `$go get` you will be able to use the shortcuts summarized below to access them and learn more about/look up commands to navigate the respective terminal applications. I want to acknowledge that I compiled this information from multiple sources, though! If not stated otherwise in the *References* section below, I simply consulted the respective man pages. 

## Dependencies
ALL these dependencies are optional in the sense that you do not need to install them to make the go code in this repository work. It will just not be functional with respect to the intended use (I guess...).
- mupdf
- feh
- cmux
- qutebrowser
- ranger
